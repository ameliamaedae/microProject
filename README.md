# microProject
 A hobby project for the Wemos D1 Mini to help me with learning C++.

## testingGrounds
Currently implementing functions for initializing wifi and mqtt connections and functions to reconnect should connections be lost.
 
## Project goal 
 Orignally I started this project to deploy MQTT IoT sensors, but I then realized I had a lot to learn when it comes to C++, so I decided to make this project more complicated than it needs to be!

### Goals (List updated 10/12/2023)
- [] Implement basic MQTT functionality
    - [] Have user settings in their own file to facilitate easier configuration 
    - [] MQTT and WIFI connection functions seperated from main.cpp 
        - [] MQTT/WIFI Initialize functions and reconnect functions
- []
