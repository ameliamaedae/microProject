# microProject
 A hobby project for the Wemos D1 Mini to help me with learning C++.

## Project goal 
 Orignally I started this project to deploy MQTT IoT sensors, but I then realized I had a lot to learn when it comes to C++, so I decided to make this project more complicated than it needs to be!

### Goals (List updated 10/16/2023)
- [x] Implement basic MQTT functionality
    - [x] Have user settings in their own file to facilitate easier configuration 
    - [x] MQTT and WIFI connection functions seperated from main.cpp 
        - [] (SCRAPPED) MQTT/WIFI Initialize functions and reconnect functions
- [] Add RGB LED indicator to board to help with debugging.
